## here all java basic question 


# 1 
Create a Person class with properties name (String) and age (int). Implement the Comparable interface to compare Person objects based on their age. Then, create a list of Person objects, sort them using their natural ordering, and print the sorted list. Next, use a Comparator to sort the same list by the name property and print the sorted list.
# 2
Implement a generic class Box that can store an object of any type T. Include methods to set and get the object. Demonstrate its usage by creating instances of Box for different types (e.g., Integer, String) and show how type safety is ensured at compile time.
# 3
Given a list of strings, use the Streams API to perform the following operations in sequence: filter out strings that are shorter than 4 characters, convert each string to uppercase, and collect the results into a new list. Print the original list and the transformed list.
# 4
Create a serializable Student class with properties name (String) and studentId (int). Write a program that serializes a list of Student objects to a file and then deserializes them back, printing the deserialized objects to verify the process.
# 5
Implement a simple bank account class with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance. Ensure that these methods are thread-safe using synchronization. Then, simulate a scenario where multiple threads are making deposits and withdrawals concurrently, and verify that the account balance remains accurate.

# Assignment: File Handling and Analysis System in Java

### Background

File handling is a crucial aspect of software development, allowing programs to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Java provides robust support for file I/O operations, making it possible to develop sophisticated applications that handle various data formats.

### Objective

Develop a Java application that performs various file operations including reading, writing, and analyzing text files. The application should offer the following functionalities:

1. **Read a Text File**: Prompt the user for a file path, read the contents of the file, and display them on the console.
2. **Write to a Text File**: Allow the user to input text from the console and write it to a specified file. If the file does not exist, your program should create it.
3. **Analyze File Content**: After reading a file, the application should analyze its contents and provide:
    - The total number of words.
    - The number of unique words.
    - The frequency of each word (how many times each unique word appears in the text).

### Requirements

- **User Interaction**: The application should be user-friendly, with clear prompts and error messages for incorrect inputs or file paths.
- **Exception Handling**: Properly handle exceptions, such as `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException`, with meaningful messages to the user.
- **Efficiency**: Implement efficient algorithms for text analysis, especially for calculating word frequency in large files.
- **Modularity**: Structure your code with separate methods for each functionality, ensuring code reusability and simplicity.

### Suggested Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Project Environment**: Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
2. **Implement File Reading**: Use `BufferedReader` or `Scanner` to read file content.
3. **Implement File Writing**: Use `FileWriter` or `PrintWriter` to write user input to a file.
4. **Implement Content Analysis**:
    - Use a `HashMap<String, Integer>` to track word frequencies.
    - Consider using a regular expression to split text into words.
5. **User Interface**: Implement a simple text-based user interface in the console for interaction.
6. **Testing**: Test your application with files of varying sizes and content to ensure accuracy and performance.

### Deliverables

1. **Source Code**: Submit the Java source files for your application.
2. **Documentation**: Include comments in your code explaining key sections and algorithms. Provide a README file explaining how to compile and run your application, along with examples of input/output.
3. **Reflection**: Write a brief reflection on what challenges you faced during this assignment and how you overcame them. Discuss what you learned about file handling and data processing in Java.
